  <p>Welcome to the Nana devoted website. The name itself is only a joke, but this website will have the history of the ice climbers. </p>
    <p>This website won't have anything that can be considered helpful in any smash game, this is all only for entertainment.</p>
    <p>Check out another ice climber website that a friend of mine made.</p>
