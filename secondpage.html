    <h1>This Page will be dedicated to the ice climber's origin and their history in-game. </h1>
    <p> The Ice Climbers' first appearance in game history was "Ice Climber" in 1984.</p>
    <h2>The Ice climbers Traction</h2>
    <p>The Ice climbers only appeared in one game series until Smash Bros came out. You can play as the duo Popo and Nana, and fight other characters from the smash universe.
      Then with the "newest" instalment of the Smash Bros series, you can still play as the Ice CLimbers with a few new abilities..</p>
